BO'S BATTLESHIPS!

Fully functional battleship game using HTML CSS and JS.
Originally made to play against a computer but hopefully the repo has been updated to have:

- A fun design to make the game more visually pleasing
- Additional button and functions for more ease of use features
- playable for two player so the game hides the screen for other user
- sound effects that will play with each step of the game

















Ultimately hope you love the game son! I love you so much Bo!
